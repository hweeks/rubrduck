# 1. Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to add a Terminal User Interface (TUI) regression test suite to the existing codebase. This will improve the system quality by allowing for more comprehensive tests to be run automatically, ensuring the TUI behaves as expected under various conditions and after changes to the codebase.

Our desired outcome is a robust and reliable TUI test suite that efficiently flags regressions and ensures every component functions as designed. We aim to decrease breakage from future code changes and ultimately enhance the reliability and user experience of our TUI.

# 2. Technical Analysis
The project will involve creating a new test suite, which will include new test files. We will use the existing testing tools and libraries available in the system to ensure compatibility with our current codebase and testing infrastructure.

Given this test suite involves TUI, we need to consider capture and comparison of terminal output. This type of testing might require specific libraries or tools to simulate user input and evaluate terminal output.

# 3. Implementation Roadmap
## Phase 1: Exploration and Design 
### Task 1.1: Analyze existing testing infrastructure
- **File Path:** Varies depending on where the project's tests are located.
- **Instructions:** Use the `file_operations` tool to read present test files and understand the current testing infrastructure.

### Task 1.2: TUI testing tool research 
- **Instructions:** Conduct research to identify appropriate tools or libraries needed specifically for testing the TUI components. Ensure the selected tool is compatible with our existing infrastructure.

### Task 1.3: Draft TUI test cases
- **File Path:** `.duckie/TUI_test_cases.duck`
- **Instructions:** Identify key scenarios the TUI should handle correctly and draft test cases accordingly. Write these to the '.duckie/TUI_test_cases.duck' file using the `file_operations` tool.

## Phase 2: Test Suite Setup 
### Task 2.1: Install TUI testing tools
- **Instructions:** Once appropriate tools are identified, use the `shell_execute` tool to install them in the project.

### Task 2.2: Configure the testing suite
- **File Path:** Varies depending on where our testing configuration is stored.
- **Instructions:** Set up and configure the new testing suite appropriately using the new TUI testing tools.

## Phase 3: Test Implementation and Integration
### Task 3.1: Implement the TUI test cases
- **File Path:** `tests/TUI_regression_tests/`
- **Instructions:** Based on the drafted test cases, start implementing the tests using the tools installed. Create a new file for each test case in the 'tests/TUI_regression_tests/' directory. 

### Task 3.2: Integrate test suite into CI/CD pipeline
- **Instructions:** Once tests are created, use the `file_operations` tool and `shell_execute` tool to integrate the test suite into our CI/CD pipeline. This ensures tests are automatically run for future code changes.

# 4. Risk Assessment
- There exists a risk of selecting an inappropriate testing tool which might not fulfill all TUI testing requirements. To mitigate this, sufficient research should be conducted and rationale for tool selection documented.
- If tests are not properly integrated into CI/CD, they might not run when they are supposed to. Therefore, the integration process should be carefully implemented and verified.
- Poorly written tests might fail to catch critical regressions. Each test must be well-considered to ensure it effectively tests its respective TUI functionality.

# 5. Validation Strategy
- Run the test suite manually and confirm all tests pass and function as intended.
- Make minor adjustments to the TUI and observe whether relevant tests fail, thus ensuring the suite effectively captures regressions.
- Confirm tests run automatically within the CI/CD pipeline after test suite integration.
- Monitor future code changes to confirm that tests are triggered and function as expected.
