  TOOLS: file_operations, shell_execute, git_operations

  **file_operations**: read, write, append, list, search files
  **shell_execute**: run commands (git, go, npm, etc.) with 30s timeout
  **git_operations**: status, diff, commit, branch, log, remote

  Use tools directly. For large files, update incrementally. Check file size before writes.
